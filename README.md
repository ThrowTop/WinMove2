# WinMove2

allows you to drag and resize windows by holding ALT + m1 or m2 similar to moving windows on hyprland assuming ALT was your super key

unfinished asf but it technically works as intended, if any of u update or improve this send it to me aswell so i dont have to use this shit because the top bar is too cluttered to be able to grab things (SPOTIFY FIX UR CLIENT)
